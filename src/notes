On mobile if screen is over a button have the button's assigned hover effect happen automatically.

just spent an hour trying to figure out why my hambuger menu disappeared. actually want to scream.. if I name the class of 
hambuger menu "hambuger", it completely deletes it.
I have no idea why, i probably just accidentally deleted something.
Now im forced to name everthing hamburg which is awful
